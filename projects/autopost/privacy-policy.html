                obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the
                third party content on the Service. Additionally, we
                may implement third party buttons (such as the
                Facebook “share” button) that may function as web
                beacons even when you do not interact with the button.
                Information collected through third-party web beacons
                and buttons is collected directly by these third
                parties, not by 2NinePost. Information collected by a
                third party in this manner is subject to that third
                party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure
                policies.

                  <p>
                    2NinePost may sell, transfer or otherwise share some
                    or all of its assets, including your Personal
                    Information, in connection with a merger,
                    acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or
                    in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the
                    opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the
                    new entity’s planned processing of your
                    information differs materially from that set forth
                    in this Privacy Policy.

              <dd>
                2NinePost is very concerned about safeguarding the
                confidentiality of your Personal Information. We
                employ administrative, physical and electronic
                measures designed to appropriately protect your
                Personal Information against accidental or unlawful
                destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration,
                unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any
                other unlawful form of processing of the Personal
                Information in our possession.
              </dd>
              <dd>
                Please be aware that no security measures are perfect
                or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information
                about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed,
                altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
                administrative, physical, and electronic safeguards,
                subject to requirements under applicable law to ensure
                or warrant information security.
              </dd>
              <dd>
                We will make any legally-required disclosures of any
                breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity
                of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal
                Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on
                our Site in the most expedient time possible and
                without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the
                legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any
                measures necessary to determine the scope of the
                breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the
                data system , and any other disclosures that may be
                required under applicable law.
              </dd>
              <dd>
                We also take measures to delete your Personal
                Information or keep it in a form that does not permit
                identifying you when this information is no longer
                necessary for the purposes for which we process it,
                unless we are required by law to keep this information
                for a longer period. When determining the retention
                period, we take into account various criteria, such as
                the type of products and services requested by or
                provided to you, the nature and length of our
                relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our
                products or services, the impact on the services we
                provide to you if we delete some information from or
                about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law
                and the statute of limitations.

              <dd>
                2NinePost may contain links to other websites. The fact
                that we link to a website is not an endorsement,
                authorization or representation of our affiliation
                with that third party. We do not exercise control over
                third party websites. These other websites may place
                their own cookies or other files on your computer,
                collect data or solicit personally identifiable
                information from you. Other sites follow different
                rules regarding the use or disclosure of the
                personally identifiable information you submit to
                them. We are not responsible for the content, privacy
                and security practices, and policies of third-party
                sites or services to which links or access are
                provided through the Service. We encourage you to read

                websites you visit.

              <dd>
                2NinePost is based in the Vietnam. Personal Information
                that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at,
                any of our affiliates, partners or service providers
                which may be inside or outside of Vietnam. By
                submitting your personal data, you agree to such
                transfers. Your Personal Information may be
                transferred to countries that do not have the same
                data protection laws as the country in which you
                initially provided the information. When we transfer
                or disclose your Personal Information to other
                countries, we will protect that information as
                described in this Privacy Policy.

              <dt>13. Our Policy Towards Children</dt>
              <dd>
                The Site is not directed to persons under 16. If a
                parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child
                has provided us with personally identifiable
                information without their consent, he or she should
                contact us at cskh@2NinePost.vn. We do not knowingly
                collect personally identifiable information from
                children under 16. If we become aware that a child
                under 16 has provided us with personal identifiable
                Information, we will delete such information from our
                files.
              </dd>
              <dt>14. Your rights</dt>
              <dd>
                You can contact us to obtain a copy of the Personal
                Information held about you by us. This may be subject
                to a fee not exceeding any prescribed fee permitted by
                applicable law, if any. You can also ask us to correct
                and, where relevant, erase that information. As
                mentioned above you have a right to change your email
                preferences at any time.
              </dd>
              <dd>
                If you are a registered user of the Site, you may
                access and update or correct the information you
                provided to us by e-mailing us at cskh@2NinePost. Please
                note that while any changes you make will be reflected
                in active user databases within a reasonable period of
                time, we may retain all information you submit for
                backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse,
                analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where
                we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a
                legitimate reason to do so. To avoid any
                misunderstanding, in the event the user requests that
                all Personal Information be deleted, then 2NinePost
                shall proceed in accordance with such request in
                reasonable time. Please be aware that once you have
                deleted your account or any Personal Information
                within your account, 2NinePost will no longer hold that
                Personal Information and will thus be unable to
                restore it.

                You should be aware that 2NinePost acts as a conduit
                between our users and the various Supported Platforms
                and Third-Party Apps. In several instances, the
                content published via 2NinePost will not be in 2NinePost’s
                custody or control, and any content that has been
                shared by you through any Supported Platform or
                Third-Party Apps via the Services may continue to be
                available to third parties and the public at large, as
                this content is now under the control of the operators
                of the Supported Platforms and/or the Third-Party
                Apps.

                Where required by law, we obtain your consent for the
                processing of certain Personal Information collected
                by cookies or similar technologies, or used to send
                you direct marketing communications, or when we carry
                out other processing activities for which consent may
                be required. If we rely on consent for the processing
                of your Personal Information, you have the right to
                withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you
                do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the
                processing before your consent withdrawal.
